/**
 * ES6 Harmony Collections Polyfill
 * ES6 Harmony Collections  was added as a polyfill to provide a lightweight unobtrusive shim for
 * ES2015 collections. The implementations of Map, Set, and WeakMap provided by this polyfill
 * adhere to the ES2015 standard. Functions that abide by the ES2015 standard such as Map.get()
 * and Set.has() are guaranteed to run in sublinear time rather than the expected constant time
 * for a standard hashmap implementation. (See http://stackoverflow.com/a/31092145) The alternative
 * popular library to ES6 Harmony Collections is ES6 shim. After running some samples tests, we have
 * determined that ES6 Harmony Collections performs better on a larger set of operations than
 * the es6-shim. (Tests were run here: https://jsperf.com/es6-shim-vs-es6-collections/2 ).
 * ES6 shim is also a much larger library in size, so the decision stick with ES6 collections
 * was easy to make.

 * As a temporary workaround, we will polyfill the missing forEach() method for Firefox.
