# sp-module-loader

Built on familiar standards such
as [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) and [WebPack](https://webpack.github.io/),
the module loader is the first part of the SharePoint Framework to load on a page.  It
manages versioning and loading of client-side components, web parts, and other assets.
It also provides basic diagnostic services.

*This package is part of the [SharePoint Framework](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/wiki),
which is a collection of NPM packages that empower developers to create client-side experiences
for [Microsoft SharePoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration).
The SharePoint Framework is currently in Preview, and is subject to change based on customer feedback.
