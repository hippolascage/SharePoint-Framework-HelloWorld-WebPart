     * @param json - the json string to encode.
     * @internalremarks - THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLIC DOCUMENTATION. Need for this stems from the
     * fact that JSON.stringify() does not encode all the required characters to make it safe to be
     * transported over a network. Neither does it provide an option to. Further, one might think
     * that JSON is a subset of Javascript, but it turns out that it is not. It allows for certain
     * characters that are treated as syntax errors in Javascript. On top of that the .Net WCF
     * javascript deserializer expects the JSON strings in certain format for it deserialize them
     * correctly. All in all, we need to do some special encoding to transport JSON strings over the
     * network. This implementation has been running very robustly in the pointpublishing-blogs and
     * hence I a just porting it and not tweaking the implemenation. Please talk to
     * manishga@microsoft.com in case you need to make changes to this encoding scheme.
