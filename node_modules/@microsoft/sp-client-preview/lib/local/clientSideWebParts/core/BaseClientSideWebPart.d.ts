/**
 * This abstract class implements the the base functionality for a client side web part. Every client side web part
 * needs to inherit from this class. Along with the base functionality, this class provides some APIs that can be
 * used by the web part. These APIs fall in two catagories.
 *
 * The first category of APIs provide data and functionality. Example, the web part context (i.e. this.context). This
 * API should be used to access contextual data relevant to this web part instance.
 *
 * The second category of APIs provide a base implementation for the web part lifecycle and can be overridden for an
 * updated implementation. The render() API is the only API that is mandatory to be implemented/overridden by a web
 * part. All other life cycle APIs have a base implementation and can be overridden based on the needs of the web part.
 * Please refer to the documentation of the individual APIs to make the right decision.
