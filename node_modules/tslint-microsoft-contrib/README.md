tslint-microsoft-contrib
======

A set of [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) rules used on some Microsoft projects.

Version 2.0.6
-------------
The project has been in use for at least several months on multiple projects. Please report any bugs or false positives you might find!

| **>= 3.2.x** | 2.x |
| **3.1.x** | unsupported |
| **3.0.x** | unsupported |
| **2.x**   | 1.x |

Installation
------------

    npm install tslint-microsoft-contrib

Alternately, you can download the files directly from GitHub:

* [Latest Development Version](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/tree/releases)
* [2.0.3](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/tree/npm-2.0.3)
* [2.0.2](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/tree/npm-2.0.2)
* [2.0.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/tree/npm-2.0.1)
* [2.0.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/tree/npm-2.0.0)
* [1.0.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/tree/npm-1.0.0)
* [0.0.4](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/tree/npm-0.0.4)

Configuration
-------------

##### Configure your Grunt build task

Add the new rulesDirectory to your tslint task:

    grunt.initConfig({
      tslint: {
        options: {
          rulesDirectory: 'node_modules/tslint-microsoft-contrib',
          configuration: grunt.file.readJSON("tslint.json")
        },
        files: {
          src: ['src/file1.ts', 'src/file2.ts']
        }
      }
    })

The tslint.json file does not change format when using this package. Just add our rule definitions to your existing tslint.json file.

A sample configuration file with all options is available here: [tslint.json](tslint.json)

Supported Rules
-----

Rule Name   | Description | Since
:---------- | :------------ | -------------
`chai-vague-errors`             | Avoid Chai assertions that result in vague errors. For example, asserting `expect(something).to.be.true` will result in the failure message "Expected true received false". This is a vague error message that does not reveal the underlying problem. It is especially vague in TypeScript because stack trace line numbers often do not match the source code. A better pattern to follow is the xUnit Patterns [Assertion Message](http://xunitpatterns.com/Assertion%20Message.html) pattern. The previous code sample could be better written as `expect(something).to.equal(true, 'expected something to have occurred');`| 1.0
`export-name`                   | The name of the exported module must match the filename of the source file. This is case-sensitive but ignores file extension. Since version 1.0, this rule takes a list of regular expressions as a parameter. Any export name matching that regular expression will be ignored. For example, to allow an exported name like myChartOptions, then configure the rule like this: "export-name": \[true, "myChartOptionsg"\]| 0.0.3
`import-name`                   | The name of the imported module must match the name of the thing being imported. For example, it is valid to name imported modules the same as the module name: `import Service = require('x/y/z/Service')` and `import Service from 'x/y/z/Service'`. But it is invalid to change the name being imported, such as: `import MyCoolService = require('x/y/z/Service')` and `import MyCoolService from 'x/y/z/Service'`. | 2.0.5
`jquery-deferred-must-complete` | When a JQuery Deferred instance is created, then either reject() or resolve() must be called on it within all code branches in the scope. For more examples see the [feature request](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/issues/26). | 1.0
`max-func-body-length`          | Avoid long functions. The line count of a function body must not exceed the value configured within this rule's options. <br>You can setup a general max function body length applied for every function/method/arrow function e.g. \[true, 30\] or set different maximum length for every type e.g. \[true, \{ "func-body-length": 10 , "arrow-body-length": 5, "method-body-length": 15, "ctor-body-length": 5 \}\]. To specify a function name whose parameters you can ignore for this rule, pass a regular expression as a string(this can be useful for Mocha users to ignore the describe() function) | 2.0.3
`missing-jsdoc`                 | All files must have a top level [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) comment. A JSDoc comment starts with /** (not one more or one less asterisk) and a JSDoc at the 'top-level' appears without leading spaces. Trailing spaces are acceptable but not recommended. | 1.0
`missing-optional-annotation`   | Deprecated - This rule is now enforced by the TypeScript compiler. A parameter that follows one or more parameters marked as optional is not itself marked optional | 0.0.1
`mocha-avoid-only`              | Do not invoke Mocha's describe.only or it.only functions. These functions are useful ways to run a single unit test or a single test case during your build, but please be careful to not push these methods calls to your version control repositiory because it will turn off any of the other tests.| 1.0
`no-backbone-get-set-outside-model` | Avoid using model.get('x') and model.set('x', value) Backbone accessors outside of the owning model. This breaks type safety and you should define getters and setters for your attributes instead.| 1.0
`no-banned-terms`               | Do not use banned terms: [caller](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7t96kt3h(v=vs.94).aspx), [callee](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/334e1zza(v=vs.94).aspx), [eval](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/12k71sw7(v=vs.94).aspx), [arguments](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/he95z461(v=vs.94).aspx). These terms refer to functions or properties that should not be used, so it is best practice to simply avoid them. | 0.0.1
`no-constant-condition`         | Do not use constant expressions in conditions. Similar to the [ESLint no-constant-condition](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-constant-condition) rule | 1.0
`no-control-regex`              | Do not use control characters in regular expressions . Similar to the [ESLint no-control-regex](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-control-regex) rule | 1.0
`no-cookies`                    | Do not use cookies | 0.0.1
`no-delete-expression`          | Do not delete expressions. Only properties should be deleted | 0.0.2
`no-disable-auto-sanitization`  | Do not disable auto-sanitization of HTML because this opens up your page to an XSS attack. Specifically, do not use the [execUnsafeLocalFunction](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh767331.aspx) or [setInnerHTMLUnsafe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211696.aspx) functions. | 0.0.1
`no-document-domain`            | Do not write to document.domain. Scripts setting document.domain to any value should be validated to ensure that the value is on a list of allowed sites. Also, if your site deals with PII in any way then document.domain must not be set to a top-level domain (for example, live.com) but only to an appropriate subdomain (for example, billing.live.com). If you are absolutely sure that you want to set document.domain then add a tslint suppression comment for the line. For more information see the [Phase 4 Verification page of the Microsoft SDL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc307418.aspx)| 2.0.3
`no-document-write`             | Do not use document.write | 0.0.1
`no-duplicate-case`             | Do not use duplicate case labels in switch statements. Similar to the [ESLint no-duplicate-case](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-duplicate-case.html) rule | 1.0
`no-duplicate-parameter-names`  | Deprecated - This rule is now enforced by the TypeScript compiler. Do not write functions or methods with duplicate parameter names | 0.0.1
`no-empty-interfaces`           | Do not use empty interfaces. They are compile-time only artifacts and they serve no useful purpose | 1.0
`no-empty-line-after-opening-brace` | Avoid an empty line after an opening brace. | 2.0.6
`no-exec-script`                | Do not use the execScript functions | 0.0.1
`no-for-in`                     | Avoid use of for-in statements. They can be replaced by Object.keys | 1.0
`no-function-constructor-with-string-args` | Do not use the version of the Function constructor that accepts a string argument to define the body of the function | 0.0.1
`no-function-expression`        | Do not use function expressions; use arrow functions (lambdas) instead. In general, lambdas are simpler to use and avoid the confusion about what the 'this' references points to. Function expressions that contain a 'this' reference are allowed and will not create a failure. | 1.0
`no-http-string`                | Do not use strings that start with 'http:'. URL strings should start with 'https:'. Http strings can be a security problem and indicator that your software may suffer from cookie-stealing attacks. Since version 1.0, this rule takes a list of regular expressions as a parameter. Any string matching that regular expression will be ignored. For example, to allow http connections to example.com and examples.com, configure your rule like this: "no-http-string": \[true, "http://www.example.com/?.*", "http://www.examples.com/?.*"\]| 0.0.3
`no-increment-decrement`        | Avoid use of increment and decrement operators particularly as part of complicated expressions | 0.0.1
`no-inner-html`                 | Do not write values to innerHTML, outerHTML, or set HTML using the JQuery html() function. Writing values to innerHTML can expose your website to XSS injection attacks. All strings must be escaped before being rendered to the page.| 2.0.4
`no-invalid-regexp`             | Do not use invalid regular expression strings in the RegExp constructor. Similar to the [ESLint no-invalid-regexp](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-invalid-regexp.html) rule| 1.0
`no-missing-visibility-modifiers` | Class members (both fields and methods) should have visibility modifiers specified. THe Principle of Least Visibility guides us to prefer private methods and fields when possible. If a developer forgets to add a modifier then TypeScript assumes the element should be public, which is the wrong default choice. | 1.0
`no-multiline-string`           | Do not declare multiline strings | 0.0.1
`no-multiple-var-decl`          | Deprecated - This rule is now part of the base TSLint product as the rule named 'one-variable-per-declaration'. Do not use comma separated variable declarations | 1.0
`no-octal-literal`              | Do not use octal literals or escaped octal sequences | 0.0.1
`no-regex-spaces`               | Do not use multiple spaces in a regular expression literal. Similar to the [ESLint no-regex-spaces](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-regex-spaces.html) rule | 1.0
`no-relative-imports`           | Do not use relative paths when importing external modules or ES6 import declarations. | 2.0.5
`no-reserved-keywords`          | Do not use reserved keywords as names of local variables, fields, functions, or other identifiers. | 0.0.1
`no-sparse-arrays`              | Do not use sparse arrays. Sparse arrays contain empty slots, most frequently due to multiple commas being used in an array literal. Based on the [ESLint no-sparse-arrays](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-sparse-arrays) rule | 1.0
`no-stateless-class`            | A stateless class represents a failure in the object oriented design of the system. A class without state is better modeled as a module or given some state. A stateless class is defined as a class with only static members and no parent class.| 2.0.4
`no-string-based-set-immediate` | Do not use the version of setImmediate that accepts code as a string argument. However, it is acceptable to use the version of setImmediate where a direct reference to a function is provided as the callback argument | 0.0.1
`no-string-based-set-interval`  | Do not use the version of setInterval that accepts code as a string argument. However, it is acceptable to use the version of setInterval where a direct reference to a function is provided as the callback argument | 0.0.1
`no-string-based-set-timeout`   | Do not use the version of setTimeout that accepts code as a string argument. However, it is acceptable to use the version of setTimeout where a direct reference to a function is provided as the callback argument | 0.0.1
`no-unexternalized-strings`     | Ensures that double quoted strings are passed to a localize call to provide proper strings for different locales. The rule can be configured using an object literal as document in the [feature request](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/issues/95#issuecomment-173149989)| 2.0.1
`no-unnecessary-bind`           | Do not bind 'this' as the context for a function literal or lambda expression. If you bind 'this' as the context to a function literal, then you should just use a lambda without the bind. If you bind 'this' as the context to a lambda, then you can remove the bind call because 'this' is already the context for lambdas. Works for Underscore methods as well.  | 1.0
`no-unnecessary-local-variable` | Do not declare a variable only to return it from the function on the next line. It is always less code to simply return the expression that initializes the variable. | 2.0.4
`no-unnecessary-override`       | Do not write a method that only calls super() on the parent method with the same arguments. You can safely remove methods like this and Javascript will correctly dispatch the method to the parent object. | 2.0.4
`no-unnecessary-semicolons`     | Remove unnecessary semicolons | 0.0.1
`no-unused-imports`             | Remove unused imports | 0.0.1
`no-with-statement`             | Do not use with statements. Assign the item to a new variable instead | 0.0.1
`prefer-array-literal`          | Use array literal syntax when declaring or instantiating array types. For example, prefer the Javascript form of string[] to the TypeScript form Array<string>. Prefer '[]' to 'new Array()'. Prefer '[4, 5]' to 'new Array(4, 5)'. Prefer '[undefined, undefined]' to 'new Array(4)'. | 1.0
`prefer-const`                  | Use `const` to declare variables if they are only assigned a value once. | 2.0.6
`prefer-type-cast`              | Prefer the tradition type casts instead of the new 'as-cast' syntax. For example, prefer '<string>myVariable' instead of 'myVariable as string'. Rule ignores any file ending in .tsx. If you prefer the opposite and want to see the 'as type' casts, then enable the tslint rule named 'no-angle-bracket-type-assertion'| 2.0.4
`promise-must-complete`         | When a Promise instance is created, then either the reject() or resolve() parameter must be called on it within all code branches in the scope. For more examples see the [feature request](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/issues/34). | 1.0
`react-no-dangerous-html`       | Do not use React's dangerouslySetInnerHTML API. This rule finds usages of the dangerouslySetInnerHTML API (but not any JSX references). For more info see the [react-no-dangerous-html Rule wiki page](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/wiki/react-no-dangerous-html-Rule). | 0.0.2
`use-isnan`                     | Deprecated - This rule is now part of the base TSLint product. Ensures that you use the isNaN() function to check for NaN references instead of a comparison to the NaN constant. Similar to the [use-isnan ESLint rule](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/use-isnan).| 1.0
`use-named-parameter`           | Do not reference the arguments object by numerical index; instead, use a named parameter. This rule is similar to JSLint's [Use a named parameter](https://jslinterrors.com/use-a-named-parameter) rule. | 0.0.3
`valid-typeof`                  | Ensures that the results of typeof are compared against a valid string. This rule aims to prevent errors from likely typos by ensuring that when the result of a typeof operation is compared against a string, that the string is a valid value. Similar to the [valid-typeof ESLint rule](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/valid-typeof).| 1.0


Development
-----------

To develop tslint-microsoft-contrib simply clone the repository, install dependencies and run grunt:

    git config --global core.autocrlf input
    git config --global core.eol lf
    git clone git@github.com:Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib.git
    cd tslint-microsoft-contrib
    npm install
    grunt all
    grunt create-rule --rule-name=no-something-or-other

Debug code
-----------
If command fails because of file access permissions, prefix it with sudo.

    npm install -g node-inspector

Then run:

    node-debug grunt mochaTest

The `node-debug` command will load Node Inspector in your default browser (works in Chrome and Opera only).

Set a breakpoint somewhere in your code and resume execution. Your breakpoint should be hit.
